# Quick Multer

Quickly hosting a website upload/download for remote file copy. This is really insecure. Only use it for files that you don't mind people seeing on your LAN.

Thanks to [https://codeforgeek.com/2014/11/file-uploads-using-node-js/] for the code used here. Shameless copy and paste going on (with some minor tweaking to be generic for files and not just images)!
